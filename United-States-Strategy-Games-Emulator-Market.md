The under 24 age group is largely driven by nostalgia, as younger players often look for ways to experience the games their parents or older siblings enjoyed in the past. With the availability of emulators, this demographic can easily access a vast array of older strategy games from a variety of platforms, including gaming consoles, PCs, and smartphones. These individuals also tend to be highly tech-savvy and are adept at using software tools to enhance their gaming experience. As mobile gaming continues to grow in popularity, this age group is likely to remain one of the most significant consumers of emulators, using smartphones and tablets to access both new and old strategy games. <p>The 24-35 age group is another crucial segment in the United States Strategy Games Emulator Market.
